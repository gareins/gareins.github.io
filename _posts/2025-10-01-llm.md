# IT work

A few years now I've been an IT support guy on a couple of musical schools. This means working with many non technical people. Some are still fairly proficient, but some despise anything to do with computers so I try my best to make things work. But this always requires for them to actually do basic things like to read the emails I send to them regarding what was set up for them. But sometimes they just don't read them and prefer to ask the same thing I just answered or ask the same thing I was explaining to them 2 hours ago and they were nodding like they understand everything. But I still need to reply, this is my job.

# Solution

So this is why I use LLM (I prefer Mistral LeChat for this), just tell him basic instructions and paste in the email thread. If I am fealling a bit naughty, I'll even instruct him to make things a bit longer than neccessary, as opose to my usual short and to the point emails (at least this is what I strive for). Anyway, this is all I wanted to say, this is right off of me sending one such emails.

Also, naturally, don't forget to proof read the reply, you never know whit these tools.
