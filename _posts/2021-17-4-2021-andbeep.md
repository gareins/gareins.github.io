# Notify when a script finishes

As part of my job, I build an android app that needs about 2-3 minutes to compile and assemble. There unfortunately is no easy way to make this faster, so I have to go along. 
This causes that when the app is building I switch to another task (or youtube video) and 10 minutes later I forget what I was doing and the work really gets done very slowly.

For this reason I implemented a simple script, that I had put in `/usr/local/bin/andbeep` and made executable. This is the contents:

```
#!/bin/bash
$@; 
result=$?
espeak "Finished with $result"
exit $result
```

This now simply informs me when a command finished and also tells me its return value. For a build script now just prepend it with a andbeep and run it, so if you use `make all` to run
your build, just use `andbeep make all` to get notified when the build finishes.
