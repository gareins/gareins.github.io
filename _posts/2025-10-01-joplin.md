# Joplin

Joplin is a good solution for my needs, it takes notes, it stores them, it synchronizes them between devices. I was interested in self hosting a minimal version without postgress and transcribe, just minimal sqlite version for myself please. Also as a good alternative, I think there are some [good small webdav docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/baksili/webdav-server) that could be used for Joplin synchronization or if you already host NextCloud, use WebDAV functionality there. These alternative solutions additionally provide webdav service itself, which might come in handy :).

# Minimal setup

I wanted to use a single docker container with one sqlite database - this is the easiest to backup, restore or debug. I found a [solution](https://robinsbranch.com/joplin-on-sqlite/) that included some additional environment values (such as mailer config). Since I don't want to use mailer, [I also can't change the admin email](https://old.reddit.com/r/joplinapp/comments/wufvll/selfhosted_joplin_without_mailer_no_email/imu0qfh/), however I can simply add and edit users directly from the admin panel, as explained in the link above. 

As for the user IDs, the problem is this: the Joplin runs as a new joplin user and I would have to take care of access control to the mounted folder. But since the container only has access to single database file, I simply run it as root.

And finally, docker compose file:

```
name: Joplin
services:
  app:
    image: joplin/server:latest
    user: 0:0
    environment
      - APP_PORT=22300
      - APP_BASE_URL=https://joplin.example.com
      - SQLITE_DATABASE=/mnt/joplin.db
    ports:
      - 22300:22300
    volumes:
      - /path/to/db/file:/mnt
```
