# Joplin

Joplin is a good solution for my needs, it takes notes, it stores them, it synchronizes them between devices. I was interested in self hosting a minimal version. I did succeed, but already in the meanwhile just started using [radicale](https://radicale.org/) webdav functionality. Why spin up another docker if I dont have to?

# Minimal setup

I wanted to use a single docker container with one sqlite database - this is the easiest to backup and restore. I found a [solution](https://robinsbranch.com/joplin-on-sqlite/) that included some unknown values and mailer config which is already too much for me. Since I don't want to use mailer, [I also can't change the admin email](https://old.reddit.com/r/joplinapp/comments/wufvll/selfhosted_joplin_without_mailer_no_email/imu0qfh/), however I can simply add and edit users directly from the admin panel, as explained in the link above. 

As for the user IDs, the problem is this: the Joplin runs as a new joplin user and I would have to take care of access control to the mounted folder. But since the container only has access to single database file, I simply run it as root.

And finally, docker compose file:

```
name: Joplin
services:
  app:
    image: joplin/server:latest
    user: 0:0
    environment
      - APP_PORT=22300
      - APP_BASE_URL=https://joplin.example.com
      - SQLITE_DATABASE=/mnt/joplin.db
    ports:
      - 22300:22300
    volumes:
      - /path/to/db/file:/mnt
```
