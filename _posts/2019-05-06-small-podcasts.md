For a couple of weeks now I am successfully running [an instance](https://rss.ozbo.lt) of my [latest pet project](https://gitlab.com/gareins/smallpodcasts), so I can now write a bit about it. 

The problem that I am trying to solve is that podcast feeds and the audio files of various podcasts are too big. Especially given the fact, that I don't see any down side to compressing this stuff, since I very rarely read the description of an episode or any other metadata and the episodes themself are just people talking, so I don't need 320kbps mp3 quality. 

What this project does to solve this issue is it creats your local copy of given podcast rss feeds and audio files, pushing them to your github repo and making them available from most podcast players. More information can be found on [the gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/gareins/smallpodcasts)
